What are HTML tags

- Tags are instructions that are embedded directly into the text of the HTML document.
- Tags begin with (<) and end with (>).
- Tags are not case sensitive : <html> is equivalent to <HTML>
- HTML tags can be of two types. They are:
  * Paired Tags
  * Unpaired Tags

Comments:
Each tag describes that the browser should do something instead of simply displaying the text.

Paired Tags:
A tag is said to be a paired tag if the text is placed between a tag and its companion tag.
Text between Opening Tag and Closing Tag called "Tag Content".
In paired tags, the first tag is referred to as Opening Tag and the second tag is referred to as Closing Tag.
Closing tag should begin with '/' symbol.

Example: <html></html>, <head></head>, <body></body> etc.

Unpaired Tags:
An unpaired tag does not have a companion tag.
They are also known as Singular or Stand-Alone Tags.

Example: <meta>, <link>, <img> etc.

All these angle-bracketed words (or letters) are commonly called "HTML tags".
